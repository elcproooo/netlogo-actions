## Overview

This repository provides [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for running [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) simulations. You can use it to automate testing and execution of NetLogo models within GitHub workflows.

Currently, the repository includes only the [`setup-netlogo`](setup/action.yaml) action, which installs NetLogo on the runner machine. See the [`examples`](examples) directory for workflow examples. You can also see `setup-netlogo` in action by checking this repository's [actions](https://github.com/danielvartan/netlogo-actions/actions) page.

This action can also be integrated with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) using the [`logolink`](https://danielvartan.github.io/logolink/) R package for more advanced workflows. See [`netlogo-check`](https://github.com/danielvartan/netlogo-check) for an example of such integration.

## `setup-netlogo`

This action sets up a NetLogo environment for use in GitHub Actions by:

- Downloading a specified version of NetLogo.
- Optionally caching the installation across workflow runs.
- Setting the following environment variables:
  - `NETLOGO_HOME`: Path to the NetLogo installation directory.
  - `NETLOGO_CONSOLE`: Path to the NetLogo console executable.
- Adding `NETLOGO_HOME` to `PATH`.
- Creating symlinks for easy access to NetLogo command-line tools:
  - `netlogo`
  - `NetLogo`

### Inputs

The following inputs are supported:

- `version`: The NetLogo version to use (e.g., `"6.4.0"`). See available versions [here](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/oldversions.shtml) (default: `"7.0.2"`).
- `architecture`: The NetLogo system architecture to use (`"32"` or `"64"`) (default: `"64"`).
- `cache`: Whether NetLogo should be cached across runs or not (default:`"true"`).

### Basic Usage

A basic workflow to set up NetLogo and run a model might look like this:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, master]

name: NetLogo-check

jobs:
  NetLogo-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions: read-all
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup NetLogo
        uses: danielvartan/netlogo-actions/setup@v1

      - name: Run Experiment
        run: |
          MODEL_PATH="$NETLOGO_HOME/models/Sample Models/Biology"
          MODEL_FILE="Wolf Sheep Predation.nlogox"

          netlogo \
            --headless \
            --model "$MODEL_PATH/$MODEL_FILE" \
            --experiment "Wolf Sheep Crossing" \
            --table /tmp/output.csv

          cat /tmp/output.csv
```

### Differing Versions

You can also specify a particular NetLogo version to install:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout Repository
    uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - name: Setup NetLogo 6.4.0
    uses: danielvartan/netlogo-actions/setup@v1
    with:
      version: "6.4.0"
      architecture: "64"
```

## Supported Platforms

All actions support only **Linux** runners (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`). We do not plan to support other operating systems at this time.
